However, authorities are having a difficult time developing reliable conformity assessment procedures that assure the consumer that the same sophis- ticated technology is not working against them. This paper describes the experience of CENAM in assessing the con- formity of fuel dispensers sold inMexico to the new,more stringent regulations issued in the last two years. The issues discussed include a comparison of the measurement capabilities of modern dispensers with the tolerance accepted by the standard and the difficulties involved in verifying the software and electronic components that compute and display the total sale amount},

This paper also aims to show how electronic documents and automation, when used together, can enable the government to validate different data declared at different points in the supply chain and to indicate the most efficient allocation of government fiscals to determine points of fraud in the distribution of fuel, and the importance of a source of data that can be collected automatically, without human intervention.},

abstract = {This work presents the countermeasures taken by Inmetro in order to address the high technology frauds identified in fuel dispensers (FD). The final effect of such frauds consists in indicating a measurement result which is higher than the actual fuel quantity that the final consumer receives in the vehicle tank. Inmetro's actions to confront this problem are divided into three main work fronts: (i) fraud technical characterization and instrument vulnerabilities identification, (ii) development of technological tools to aid in inspections and issuing of expertise certificates, and (iii) discuss and establish new software and hardware security requirements for future FDs. The results obtained with these actions were the complete technical characterization and classification of the diverse fraud evidences that Inmetro has received since 2012. Additionally, a total of 81 metrologists from all over the country were trained to identify the different fraud implementations known so far. Finally, new security requirements are currently being discussed with FD manufacturers and other stakeholders so that, in the near future, a more reliable measurement is achieved by the instrument.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has become a promising ap- proach in many domains. It first came up with the cryptocur- rency Bitcoin, where it is used to maintain a distributed ledger, a public list of all transactions. It is assumed that the use of a blockchain as a cryptocurrency, or in general for financial services, was just the first stage, called Phase 1.0. The second phase began with the integration of smart contracts. In Phase 3.0, the focus lies on decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), which efficiently implement smart contracts. In the future, it is assumed, that by the use of DAOs many benefits for the public sector emerge. In this paper, blockchain applications of Phase 2.0 and 3.0 are analyzed for measuring instruments under legal control. An example are smart meters, where by smart contracts, a new coin/token within the blockchain can be created whenever the electric meter rotates. Promising areas of application in legal metrology, like a decentralized audit trail to log, e.g., software updates and hinder uncertified manipula- tions, the complete automation of the legally supervised update mechanism by smart contracts, or an alternative to public key infrastructures are being proposed in this paper.},

With the great potential of IoT, there come all kinds of challenges. This paper focuses on the security problems among all other challenges. As IoT is built on the basis of the Internet, security problems of the Internet will also show up in IoT. And as IoT contains three layers: perception layer, transportation layer and application layer, this paper will analyze the security problems of each layer separately and try to find new problems and solutions. This paper also analyzes the cross-layer heterogeneous integration issues and security issues in detail and discusses the security issues of IoT as a whole and tries to find solutions to them. In the end, this paper compares security issues between IoT and traditional network, and discusses opening security issues of IoT.},

A systematic, logical and consistent process has been used to organize and extract the contributions of published academic studies in the field. A systematic literature review process has also been shown to be an appropriate tool to manage and organize the growing number of databases for articles and journals, allowing the identification of relevant contributions. A total of 59 studies were selected and categorized based on four different approaches: the economy and society, international trade, legal metrological control, and metrology in developing countries. The 59 selected articles are discussed in order to explore the state of the art concerning legal metrology, with a focus on legal metrological control. On the basis of these categories, open issues were also identified in order to suggest future studies in the field.},

abstract = {Smart home is one of the most popular IoT (Internet of Things) applications, which connects a wide variety of objects and home appliances in a single logical network. Smart home applications have benefited from interactions and data transmissions among different devices over the integrated network with or without human interventions. However, like other technologies, smart home likely introduces new security vulnerabilities due to its dynamic and open nature of connectivity with heterogeneous features. Among such vulnerabilities, is the breach of confidentiality which needs to be addressed urgently as data exchanged between smart home devices can contain crucial information related to user's privacy and safety. However, some of the challenges in providing smart home system with confidentiality service are the flexibility of key management and efficiency of computation and communication. These challenges should be addressed carefully as many small and resource-constrained devices are usually involved in smart home systems. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a lightweight encryption scheme for smart homes. This scheme will provide users and smart objects with confidentiality service without incurring much overhead cost associated with computation and communication. Our proposed scheme also supports flexible public key management through adopting identity-based encryption, which does not require complex certificate handling. We provide a formal security analysis of our scheme and a performance simulation study. The simulation shows that our scheme provides favorable level of efficiency in terms of overhead cost associated with computation and communication.},

abstract = {According to the Taiwan Ministry of Education statistics, about one
million graduates each year, some of them will go to countries, high
schools or tertiary institutions to continue to attend, and some will be
ready to enter the workplace employment. During the course of study, the
students' all kinds of excellent performance certificates, score
transcripts, diplomas, etc., will become an important reference for
admitting new schools or new works. As schools make various awards or
diplomas, only the names of the schools and the students are input. Due
to the lack of effective anti-forge mechanism, events that cause the
graduation certificate to be forged often get noticed. In order to solve
the problem of counterfeiting certificates, the digital certificate
system based on blockchain technology would be proposed. By the
unmodifiable property of blockchain, the digital certificate with
anti-counterfeit and verifiability could be made. The procedure of
issuing the digital certificate in this system is as follows. First,
generate the electronic file of a paper certificate accompanying other
related data into the database, meanwhile calculate the electronic file
for its hash value. Finally, store the hash value into the block in the
chain system. The system will create a related QR-code and inquiry
string code to affix to the paper certificate. It will provide the
demand unit to verify the authenticity of the paper certificate through
mobile phone scanning or website inquiries. Through the unmodifiable
properties of the blockchain, the system not only enhances the
credibility of various paper-based certificates, but also electronically
reduces the loss risks of various types of certificates.},
