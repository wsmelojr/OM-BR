Unpredictability and uniqueness physical systems properties are explored to generate event identifiers from sensing information. Being unique and hard to guess, event identifiers can be used for strengthening authentication. Moreover, event identifiers provide evidences of authentication co-location and simultaneity, preventing relay and replay attacks. The authentication feasibility is demonstrated using sensing systems real cases related to vehicle crash test instrumentation, with promising results.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrency, and its underlying technologies, has been gaining popularity for transaction management beyond financial transactions. Transaction information is maintained in the block-chain, which can be used to audit the integrity of the transaction. The focus on this paper is the potential availability of block-chain technology of other transactional uses. Block-chain is one of the most stable open ledgers that preserves transaction information, and is difficult to forge. Since the information stored in block-chain is not related to personally identify information, it has the characteristics of anonymity. Also, the block-chain allows for transparent transaction verification since all information in the block-chain is open to the public. These characteristics are the same as the requirements for a voting system. That is, strong robustness, anonymity, and transparency. In this paper, we propose an electronic voting system as an application of block-chain, and describe block-chain based voting at a national level through examples.},

abstract = {Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

abstract = {A blockchain is essentially a distributed database of records, or public ledger of all transactions or digital events that have been executed and shared among participating parties. Each transaction in the public ledger is verified by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system. Once entered, information can never be erased. The blockchain contains a certain and verifiable record of every single transaction ever made. Bitcoin, the decentralized peer-to-peer digital currency, is the most popular example that uses blockchain technology. The digital currency bitcoin itself is highly controversial but the underlying blockchain technology has worked flawlessly and found wide range of applications in both financial and non-financial world. The main hypothesis is that the blockchain establishes a system of creating a distributed consensus in the digital online world. This allows participating entities to know for certain that a digital event happened by creating an irrefutable record in a public ledger. It opens the door for developing a democratic open and scalable digital economy from a centralized one. There are tremendous opportunities in this disruptive technology, and the revolution in this space has just begun. This white paper describes blockchain technology and some compelling specific applications in both financial and non-financial sector. We then look at the challenges ahead and business opportunities in this fundamental technology that is all set to revolutionize our digital world.},

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy remain a major challenge, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks. Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier. Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as ”miner” that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home. The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications. We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.},

The threats detected are categorized according to specific security goals set for the smart home/smart grid environment, and their impact on the overall system security is evaluated. A review of contemporary literature is then conducted with the aim of presenting promising security countermeasureswith respect to the identified specific security goals for each presented scenario.

More importantly, with the integration of advanced computing and communication technologies, the Smart Grid is expected to greatly enhance efficiency and reliability of future power systems with renewable energy resources, as well as distributed intelligence and demand response. Along with the silent features of the Smart Grid, cyber security emerges to be a critical issue because millions of electronic devices are inter-connected via communication networks throughout critical power facilities, which has an immediate impact on reliability of such a widespread infrastructure. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of cyber security issues for the Smart Grid. Specifically, we focus on reviewing and discussing security requirements, network vulnerabilities, attack countermeasures, secure communication protocols and architectures in the Smart Grid.

Blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-trusting members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary, in a verifiable manner. We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts—scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.},

abstract = {The emerging Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are envi- sioned to integrate computation, communication and control with the physical world. Therefore, CPS requires close- interactions between the cyber and physical worlds both in time and space. These interactions are usually governed by events, which occur in the physical world and should autonomously be reflected in the cyber-world, and actions, which are taken by the CPS as a result of detection of events and certain decision mechanisms. Both event detection and action decision operations should be performed accurately and timely to guarantee temporal and spatial correctness. This calls for a flexible architecture and task representation framework to analyze CP operations. In this paper, we explore the temporal and spatial properties of events, define a novel CPS architecture, and develop a layered spatio- temporal event model for CPS. The event is represented as a function of attribute-based, temporal, and spatial event conditions. Moreover, logical operators are used to combine different types of event conditions to capture composite events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first event model that captures the heterogeneous characteristics of CPS for formal temporal and spatial analysis.},

However, the benefit of localization information sharing enables trend forecasting and automation. To address this challenge, we introduce Wobly, an attribute based signature (ABS) that measures gait. Wobly passively receives Wi-Fi beacons and produces human signatures based on the Doppler Effect and multipath signals without attached devices and out of direct line-of-sight. Because signatures are specific to antenna placement and room configuration and do not require sensor attachments, the identities of the individuals can remain anonymous. However, the gait based signatures are still unique, and thus Wobly is able to track individuals in a building or home. Wobly uses the physical layer channel and the unique human gait as a means of encoding a person's identity. We implemented Wobly on a National Instruments Radio Frequency (RF) test bed. Using a simple naive Bayes classifier, the correct identification rate was 87{\%} with line-of-sight (LoS) and 77{\%} with non-line-of-sight (NLoS).},

abstract = {Exploiting physical layer characteristics to enhance or complement authentication strength in wireless networks has been attracting research attention recently. Existing physical layer authentication mechanisms mainly tackle single-hop communications. In this paper, we propose two physical layer challenge-response authentication mechanisms for wireless networks with relay. One mechanism, named PHY-CRAMR, is an extension of the existing PHY-CRAM protocol. It fully utilizes the randomness, reciprocity, and location decorrelation features of the wireless fading channel to hide/encrypt the challenge response messages at the physical layer, and is immune to outside attacks with a trusted relay. The other novel mechanism, named PHY-AUR, exploits randomness, coherence, and location decorrelation properties of wireless fading channel to securely convey the product of the channel state information on consecutive links and uses the fading channel to encrypt challenge and response messages. PHY-AUR is immune to both outside and inside attacks with an untrusted relay. Both PHY-CRAMR and PHY-AUR adopt OFDM technique to modulate the authentication key and challenge-response messages on subcarriers. Physical layer pilots and preambles are eliminated to prevent an attacker from gaining knowledge about the channel state information, and as a result prevent the authentication key from being revealed to untrusted attackers. We analyze the security strength of both mechanisms and conduct extensive simulations to evaluate them. It shows that both PHY-CRAMR and PHY-AUR can achieve both a high successful authentication rate and low false acceptance rate, and the performance improves as the signal to noise ratio (SNR) increases.},

abstract = {Embedded sensing systems are pervasively used in life- and security-critical systems such as those found in airplanes, automobiles, and healthcare. Traditional security mechanisms for these sensors focus on data encryption and other post-processing techniques, but the sensors themselves often remain vulnerable to attacks in the physical/analog domain. If an adversary manipulates a physical/analog signal prior to digitization, no amount of digital security mechanisms after the fact can help. Fortunately, nature imposes fundamental constraints on how these analog signals can behave. This work presents PyCRA, a physical challenge-response authentication scheme designed to protect active sensing systems against physical attacks occurring in the analog domain. PyCRA provides security for active sensors by continually challenging the surrounding environment via random but deliberate physical probes. By analyzing the responses to these probes, and by using the fact that the adversary cannot change the underlying laws of physics, we provide an authentication mechanism that not only detects malicious attacks but provides resilience against them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PyCRA through several case studies using two sensing systems: (1) magnetic sensors like those found wheel speed sensors in robotics and automotive, and (2) commercial RFID tags used in many security-critical applications. Finally, we outline methods and theoretical proofs for further enhancing the resilience of PyCRA to active attacks by means of a confusion phase---a period of low signal to noise ratio that makes it more difficult for an attacker to correctly identify and respond to PyCRA's physical challenges. In doing so, we evaluate both the robustness and the limitations of PyCRA, concluding by outlining practical considerations as well as further applications for the proposed authentication mechanism.},

abstract = {Indoor localization and asset tracking is an area of research which is finding increasing application in monitoring the wellbeing of elderly subjects in hospital or residential care environments. Radio frequency (RF) based localization methods tend to show poor performance in indoor environments, due to multipath scatter, and simple room-level misassociations, resulting from the relative transparency of some walls to RF waves. Ultrasound (US) localization has shown excellent room-level accuracy, and as US will not easily penetrate walls, room-level misassociations do not often occur. For normal asset tracking systems, the association between an asset and a room is not of critical importance; for clinical applications, which make inferences based on a patient and carer occupying the same room, this association is paramount. This paper outlines a proof of concept for an US-based indoor localization system with sub-room-level accuracy. The proposed design uses a US-based technique, with transmitter beacons placed throughout the environment. The subject wears the receiver module and is free to move throughout the environment. Transmission collisions are alleviated by assigning a unique prime transmission interval to each beacon; meaning the beacons do not require synchronization or coordination and operate independently of one another. Preliminary results show accurate detection at a range of over 5 m at a 0° angle and at approximately 3.5 m at an angle of 30°. Testing of two collocated transmitters, transmitting in the same plane and separated by 2.5 m results in accurate reception of both signals, even within the region of overlap.},

However, due to the resource constraints on sensors, it is infeasible to use traditional key management techniques such as public key cryptography and key distribution center (KDC). To facilitate the study of novel pairwise key predistribution techniques, this paper presents a general framework for establishing pairwise keys between sensors on the basis of a polynomial-based key predistribution protocol. This paper then presents two efficient instantiations of the general framework: a random subset assignment key predistribution scheme and a grid-based key predistribution scheme. The analysis in this paper indicates that these two schemes have a number of nice properties, including high probability (or guarantee) to establish pairwise keys, tolerance of node captures, and low communication overhead. Finally, this paper presents a technique to reduce the computation at sensors required by these schemes.},

UASNs and terrestrial WSNs have several common properties while there are several challenges particular to UASNs that are mostly due to acoustic communications, and inherent mobility. These challenges call for novel architectures and protocols to ensure successful operation of the UASN. Localization is one of the fundamental tasks for UASNs which is required for data tagging, node tracking, target detection, and it can be used for improving the performance of medium access and network protocols. Recently, various UASN architectures and a large number of localization techniques have been proposed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of these architectures and localization methods. To familiarize the reader with the UASNs and localization concepts, we start our paper by providing background information on localization, state-of-the-art oceanographic systems, and the challenges of underwater communications. We then present our detailed survey, followed by a discussion on the performance of the localization techniques and open research issues.},

abstract = {Two-factor authentication protects online accounts even if passwords are leaked. Most users, however, prefer password-only authentication. One reason why two-factor authentication is so unpopular is the extra steps that the user must complete in order to log in. Currently deployed two-factor authentication mechanisms require the user to interact with his phone to, for example, copy a verification code to the browser. Two-factor authentication schemes that eliminate user-phone interaction exist, but require additional software to be deployed. In this paper we propose Sound-Proof, a usable and deployable two-factor authentication mechanism. Sound-Proof does not require interaction between the user and his phone. In Sound-Proof the second authentication factor is the proximity of the user's phone to the device being used to log in. The proximity of the two devices is verified by comparing the ambient noise recorded by their microphones. Audio recording and comparison are transparent to the user, so that the user experience is similar to the one of password-only authentication. Sound-Proof can be easily deployed as it works with current phones and major browsers without plugins. We build a prototype for both Android and iOS. We provide empirical evidence that ambient noise is a robust discriminant to determine the proximity of two devices both indoors and outdoors, and even if the phone is in a pocket or purse. We conduct a user study designed to compare the perceived usability of Sound-Proof with Google 2-Step Verification. Participants ranked Sound-Proof as more usable and the majority would be willing to use Sound-Proof even for scenarios in which two-factor authentication is optional.},

Underwater acoustic (UWA) networks are generally formed by acoustically connected ocean-bottom sensors, autonomous underwater vehicles, and a surface station, which provides a link to an on-shore control center. While many applications require long-term monitoring of the deployment area, the battery-powered network nodes limit the lifetime of UWA networks. In addition, shallow-water acoustic channel characteristics, such as low available bandwidth, highly varying multipath, and large propagation delays, restrict the efficiency of UWA networks. Within such an environment, designing an UWA network that maximizes throughput and reliability while minimizing the power consumption becomes a very difficult task. The goal of this paper is to survey the existing network technology and its applicability to underwater acoustic channels.

abstract = {Neighbor discovery is a fundamental requirement and need be done frequently in underwater acoustic networks (UANs) with floating node mobility. In hostile environments, neighbor discovery is vulnerable to the wormhole attack by which the adversary uses secret wormhole links to make distant nodes falsely accept each other as neighbors. The wormhole attack may lead to many undesirable consequences and cannot be solved by cryptographic methods. Existing wormhole defenses for ground wireless networks cannot be directly applied to UANs where most of their assumptions no longer hold. This paper presents a suite of novel protocols to enable wormhole-resilient secure neighbor discovery in UANs. Our protocols are based on the Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation of acoustic signals, a basic functionality readily available in current UANs. The proposed protocols can thwart the wormhole attack with overwhelming probability without conventional hard requirements on secure and accurate time synchronization and localization. Detailed theoretical analysis and simulation results confirm the high performance of the proposed protocols. View full abstract},

In this paper, we propose a novel authentication scheme which exploits volatile passwords - One-Time Passwords (OTPs) based on the time and location information of the mobile device to transparently and securely authenticate users while accessing Internet services, such as online banking services and e-commerce transactions. Compared to a permanent password base scheme, an OTP based one can prevent users from being eavesdropped. In addition to a memoryless feature, the scheme restricts the validness of the OTP password not only in a certain time period but also in a tolerant geometric region to increase the security protection. However, if a legitimate user is not in the anticipated tolerant region, the user may fail to be authenticated. Hence, a Short Message Service (SMS) based mutual authentication mechanism is also proposed in the article to supplement the unexpected misjudgement. The proposed method with a volatile time/location-based password features more secure and more convenient for user authentication.},

abstract = {Ensemble is a system that uses a collection of trusted personal devices to provide proximity-based authentication in pervasive environments. Users are able to securely pair their personal devices with previously unknown devices by simply placing them close to each other (e.g., users can pair their phones by just bringing them into proximity). Ensemble leverages a user's growing collection of trusted devices, such as phones, music players, computers and personal sensors to observe transmissions made by pairing devices. These devices analyze variations in received signal strength (RSS) in order to determine whether the pairing devices are in physical proximity to each other. We show that, while individual trusted devices can not properly distinguish proximity in all cases, a collection of trusted devices can do so reliably. Our Ensemble prototype extends Diffie-Hellman key exchange with proximity-based authentication. Our experiments show that an Ensemble-enabled collection of Nokia N800 Internet Tablets can detect devices in close proximity and can reliably detect attackers as close as two meters away.},

If an anomaly is detected, this kind of schemes will require the user for validation (i.e., input correct PIN). In this paper, we first propose a lightweight touch-dynamics-based user authentication scheme on a touchscreen mobile phone, which consists of only 8 touch-gesture related features. In addition, we further design an adaptive mechanism that can periodically select a better classifier to maintain the authentication accuracy during user authentication. As a study, we implement a cost-based metric that enables this mechanism to choose a less costly classifier. In the evaluation, the experimental results of involving 50 participants indicate that our proposed user authentication scheme can achieve an average error rate of 2.46{\%} and that the adaptive mechanism can maintain the authentication accuracy at a relatively stable level.},

abstract = {The SMLsystem is a house built at the Universidad CEU Cardenal Herrera (CEU-UCH) to participate in the Solar Decathlon 2012 competition. Several technologies have been integrated to reduce power consumption. A predictive module, based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), has been developed using data acquired in Valencia. The module produces short-term forecast of indoor temperature, using as input data captured by a complex monitoring system. The system expects to reduce the power consumption related to Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system, due to the following assumptions: the high power consumption for which HVAC is responsible (53.9{\%} of the overall consumption); and the energy needed to maintain temperature is less than the energy required to lower/increase it. This paper studies the development viability of predictive systems for a totally unknown environment applying on-line learning techniques. The model parameters are estimated starting from a totally random model or from an unbiased a priori knowledge. These forecasting measures could allow the house to adapt itself to future temperature conditions by using home automation in an energy-efficient manner. Experimental results show reasonable forecasting accuracy with simple models, and in relatively short training time (4–5 days).},

abstract = {We present Heart-to-Heart (H2H), a system to authenticate external medical device controllers and programmers to Implantable Medi- cal Devices (IMDs). IMDs, which include pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators, are therapeutic medical devices partially or wholly embedded in the human body. They often have built-in radio com- munication to facilitate non-invasive reprogramming and data read- out. Many IMDs, though, lack well designed authentication proto- cols, exposing patients to over-the-air attack and physical harm. H2H makes use of ECG (heartbeat data) as an authentication mechanism, ensuring access only by a medical instrument in phys- ical contact with an IMD-bearing patient. Based on statistical anal- ysis of real-world data, we propose and analyze new techniques for extracting time-varying randomness from ECG signals for use in H2H. We introduce a novel cryptographic device pairing proto- col that uses this randomness to protect against attacks by active adversaries, while meeting the practical challenges of lightweight implementation and noise tolerance in ECG readings. Finally, we describe an end-to-end implementation in an ARM-Cortex M-3 mi- crocontroller that demonstrates the practicality of H2H in current IMD hardware. Previous schemes have had goals much like those of H2H, but with serious limitations making them unfit for deployment—such as na{\"{i}}vely designed cryptographic pairing protocols (some of them recently broken). In addition to its novel analysis and use of ECG entropy, H2H is the first physiologically-based IMD device pairing protocol with a rigorous adversarial model and protocol analysis.},

abstract = {We investigate the foundations of Physical Unclonable Functions from several perspectives. Firstly, we discuss formal and conceptual issues in the various current definitions of PUFs. As we argue, they have the effect that many PUF candidates formally meet no existing definition. Next, we present alternative definitions and a new formalism. It avoids asymptotic concepts like polynomial time, but is based on concrete time bounds and on the concept of a security experiment. The formalism splits the notion of a PUF into two new notions, Strong t-PUFs and Obfuscating t-PUFs. Then, we provide a comparative analysis between the existing definitions and our new notions, by classifying existing PUF implementations with respect to them. In this process, we use several new and unpublished machine learning results. The outcome of this comparative classification is that our definitions seem to match the current PUF landscape well, perhaps better than previous definitions. Finally, we analyze the security and practicality features of Strong and Obfuscating t-PUFs in concrete applications, obtaining further justification for the split into two notions.},

abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) with emphasis on enabling technologies, protocols and application issues. The IoT is enabled by the latest developments in RFID, smart sensors, communication technologies and Internet protocols. The basic premise is to have smart sensors collaborate directly without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The current revolution in Internet, mobile and machine-to-machine (M2M) technologies can be seen as the first phase of the IoT. In the coming years, the IoT is expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable new applications by connecting physical objects together in support of intelligent decision making. This paper starts by providing a horizontal overview of the IoT. Then, we give an overview of some technical details that pertain to the IoT enabling technologies, protocols and applications. Compared to other survey papers in the field, our objective is to provide a more thorough summary of the most relevant protocols and application issues to enable researchers and application developers to get up to speed quickly on how the different protocols fit together to deliver desired functionalities without having to go through RFCs and the standards specifications. We also provide an overview of some of the key IoT challenges presented in the recent literature and provide a summary of related research work. Moreover, we explore the relation between the IoT and other emerging technologies including big data analytics and cloud and fog computing. We also present the need for better horizontal integration among IoT services. Finally, we present detailed service use-cases to illustrate how the different protocols presented in the paper fit together to deliver desired IoT services.},

abstract = {A new type of authentication, call group authentication, which authenticates all users belonging to the same group is proposed in this paper. The group authentication is specially designed for group-oriented applications. The group authentication is no longer a one-to-one type of authentication as most conventional user authentication schemes which have one prover and one verifier; but, it is a many-to-many type of authentication which has multiple provers and multiple verifiers. We propose a basic t-secure m-user n-group authentication scheme ((t, m, n) GAS), where t is the threshold of the proposed scheme, m is the number of users participated in the group authentication, and n is the number of members of the group, which is based on Shamir's (t, n) secret sharing (SS) scheme. The basic scheme can only work properly in synchronous communications. We also propose asynchronous (t, m, n) GASs, one is a GAS with one-time authentication and the other is a GAS with multiple authentications. The (t, m, n) GAS is very efficient since it is sufficient to authenticate all users at once if all users are group members; however, if there are nonmembers, it can be used as a preprocess before applying conventional user authentication to identify nonmembers.},

This network can be used to monitor patients at home remotely. The information from these sensors is vulner- able and requires strong security mechanisms. Because of vulnerabilities, more effective authentication methods have been developed. However, the current authentication solu- tions require direct interaction of the user with the system, which does not respect their individuality. Thus, this dissertation proposes a strong authentication solution in which the interaction of the user with the system is removed based on biometrics and location factors. The developed authenticator was tested through different case studies to show its efficiency and feasibility before application in a real environment.},

abstract = {We demonstrate relay attacks on Passive Keyless Entry and Start (PKES) systems used in modern cars. We build two efficient and inexpensive attack realizations, wired and wireless physical-layer relays, that allow the attacker to enter and start a car by relaying messages between the car and the smart key. Our relays are completely independent of the modulation, protocol, or presence of strong authentication and encryption. We perform an extensive evaluation on 10 car models from 8 manufacturers. Our results show that relaying the signal in one direction only (from the car to the key) is sufficient to perform the attack while the true distance between the key and car remains large (tested up to 50 meters, non line-of-sight). We also show that, with our setup, the smart key can be excited from up to 8 meters. This removes the need for the attacker to get close to the key in order to establish the relay. We further analyze and discuss critical system characteristics. Given the generality of the relay attack and the number of evaluated systems, it is likely that all PKES systems based on similar designs are also vulnerable to the same attack. Finally, we propose immediate mitigation measures that minimize the risk of relay attacks as well as recent solutions that may prevent relay attacks while preserving the convenience of use, for which PKES systems were initially introduced.},

abstract = {Wireless networks are being integrated into the modern automobile. The security and privacy implications of such in-car networks, however, have are not well understood as their transmissions propagate beyond the con- nes of a car's body. To understand the risks associated with these wireless systems, this paper presents a privacy and security evaluation of wireless Tire Pressure Monitoring Systems using both laboratory experiments with isolated tire pressure sensor modules and experiments with a complete vehicle system. We show that eavesdropping is easily possible at a distance of roughly 40m from a passing vehicle. Further, reverse-engineering of the underlying protocols revealed static 32 bit identi- ers and that messages can be easily triggered remotely, which raises privacy concerns as vehicles can be tracked through these identiers. Further, current protocols do not employ authentication and vehicle implementations do not perform basic input validation, thereby allowing for remote spoong of sensor messages. We validated this experimentally by triggering tire pressure warning messages in a moving vehicle from a customized software radio attack platform located in a nearby vehicle. Finally, the paper concludes with a set of recommendations for improving the privacy and security of tire pressure monitoring systems and other forthcoming in-car wireless sensor networks.},

abstract = {Appliance Load Monitoring (ALM) is essential for energy management solutions, allowing them to obtain appliance-specific energy consumption statistics that can further be used to devise load scheduling strategies for optimal energy utilization. Fine-grained energy monitoring can be achieved by deploying smart power outlets on every device of interest; however it incurs extra hardware cost and installation complexity. Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an attractive method for energy disaggregation, as it can discern devices from the aggregated data acquired from a single point of measurement. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of NILM system and its associated methods and techniques used for disaggregated energy sensing. We review the state-of-the art load signatures and disaggregation algorithms used for appliance recognition and highlight challenges and future research directions.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general-purpose computing. This report examines the potential technical obstacles impeding progress, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.},

abstract = {Embedded systems form the basis of all devices that are currently growing. With increasingly sophisticated technology advancements the dimensions of the devices are getting smaller, and the computing capabilities are now almost on par with the PC in the past two to three years. Based on those abilities the device can be paired with other components such as wireless communication technology, sensors and other supporting components to determine the state of the environment, or actuators as well to give response. Because all of these things take place in the digital world, there arose a discourse what if the digital world were to be combined with the physical world. A system that combines the capabilities of computing, communications and data storage, in order to monitor or control the entities that exist in the physical are world called Cyber Physical Systems. This paper will discuss the things that happened in the early progression of CPS topics (2006 - 2013), as the process of declaring the term CPS, reviews by the research group guided by Edward A Lee in the CPS field, CPS development in terms of scientific publications in the International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS), and further research opportunities based on the direction of the development of research topics in the CPS field.},

abstract = {The increase of online services, such as eBanks, WebMails, in which users are verified by a username and password, is increasingly exploited by identity theft procedures. Identity Theft is a fraud, in which someone pretends to be someone else is order to steal money or get other benefits. To overcome the problem of identity Theft an additional security layer is required. Within the last decades the option of verifying users based on their keystroke dynamics was proposed during login verification. Thus, the imposter has to be able to type in a similar way to the real user in addition to having the username and password. However, verifying users upon login is not enough, since a logged station/mobile is vulnerable for imposters when the user leaves her machine. Thus, verifying users continuously based on their activities is required. Within the last decade there is a growing interest and use of biometrics tools, however, these are often costly and require additional hardware. Behavioral biometrics, in which users are verified, based on their keyboard and mouse activities, present potentially a good solution. In this paper we discuss the problem of identity theft and propose behavioral biometrics as a solution. We survey existing studies and list the challenges and propose solutions.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated and now incorporate many diverse and powerful sensors. The latest generation of smart phones is especially laden with sensors, including GPS sensors, vision sensors (cameras), audio sensors (microphones), light sensors, temperature sensors, direction sensors (compasses), and acceleration sensors. In this paper we describe and evaluate a system that uses phone-based acceleration sensors, called accelerometers, to identify and authenticate cell phone users. This form of behavioral biométrie identification is possible because a person's movements form a unique signature and this is reflected in the accelerometer data that they generate. To implement our system we collected accelerometer data from thirty-six users as they performed normal daily activities such as walking, jogging, and climbing stairs, aggregated this time series data into examples, and then applied standard classification algorithms to the resulting data to generate predictive models. These models either predict the identity of the individual from the set of thirty-six users, a task we call user identification, or predict whether (or not) the user is a specific user, a task we call user authentication. This work is notable because it enables identification and authentication to occur unobtrusively, without the users taking any extra actions-all they need to do is carry their cell phones. There are many uses for this work. For example, in environments where sharing may take place, our work can be used to automatically customize a mobile device to a user. It can also be used to provide device security by enabling usage for only specific users and can provide an extra level of identity verification.},

User authentication is performed exploiting the behavioural variations between different users. The upper body limb anthropometric information is extracted for each user and an attributed body-related graph structure framework is employed for the detection of static biometric features of substantial discrimination power. Finally, a quality factor based on ergonomic criteria evaluates the recognition capacity of each activity. Experimental validation illustrates that the proposed approach for integrating static anthropometric features and activity-related recognition advances significantly the authentication performance.},

abstract = {Traffic crashes on urban freeways account for thousands of lives lost and billions of dollars wasted every year in America. Previous research has shown that certain freeway conditions are more susceptible to crashes occurring than others. These conditions are said to have a high crash potential. The purpose of this research is to test the effects of intelligent transportation system (ITS) strategies on reducing the potential for crashes to occur on a major urban freeway. In this research, Interstate-4 in Orlando, Florida was simulated using the PARAMICS micro-simulation software package. The crash potential was then determined through models that were created in the previous research conducted by Abdel-Aty et al. (2005) using logistic regression to associate traffic characteristics with the risk of a crash occurring. Several mitigation strategies were used while simulating the freeway and the crash potential was determined for each technique. The before (pre-ITS) and after case were then compared to examine the effects of the crash mitigation methods. The results of this research show that variable speed limits (VSL) have a positive effect on lowering the crash potential during high-speed conditions. VSL does not affect the low-speed case but if ramp metering is instead implemented the potential for a significant reduction in the crash potential is realized. However, there are still more strategies that need to be tested including route diversion, lane change restrictions, and feedback controlled ramp metering},

These days the Swede rigging up plenty of Fords for crash tests. Ford owns the prestigious Volvo, Jaguar, and Aston Martin car companies, and has made Sweden its center of excellence for vehicle safety testing. There's a good reason why the second-largest US car maker has ceded this area of expertise to a non-US supplier: few auto companies have won as many awards for car safety as Volvo. This article discusses safety testing of cars at Volvo using virtual crashes and real crashes. The unique features of the test facilities are briefly outlined including the two intersecting test tracks: a 154-meter fixed track and an 80-meter movable one that can be turned as much as 90 degrees. Front and side collisions can thus be tested at virtually all angles. If the back door at the end of the movable track is opened, cars can be sent flying directly into the rocky hillside outside. For so-called barrier tests, a single car on the fixed track hurtles into an 850-ton block at the far end.},

abstract = {In the past two decades, occupant restraint systems for automobiles have made considerable progress globally. There has been a tremendous increase in the complexity and sophistication of functional requirements. Particularly significant in the overall evolution of restraint systems is the growth in electronics content, which is concurrent with similar phenomena in the automotive world, as well as in many other technology-related fields. In conjunction with this trend, the shift to digital components and subsystems expanded, while the design of restraint systems has become more diversified with enhanced adaptability and flexibility. In addition to the airbags that are standardized for passenger vehicles, there has been a whole spectrum of emerging safety features that provide additional safety improvements. For example, rollover and occupant sensing are being added onto an integrated occupant protection system. Global positioning systems are coupled with crash sensors into emergency notification services. Increasingly, vehicles are now being equipped with active safety systems. The availability of both passive restraints and active safety functions will allow an additional layer of synergistic integration across safety systems. Research and developments in vehicular safety can be expected to remain active in the foreseeable future. This paper describes the system-level design trends that have occurred in the past and offers a perspective of future design transition in automotive restraint systems},

Radio Signal Strength (RSS) is a key parameter for wireless positioning. New Bluetooth standard (since version 2.1) enables RSS to be discovered without time consuming pre-connection. In this research, general wireless positioning technologies are firstly analysed. Then RSS based Bluetooth positioning using the new feature is studied. The mathematical model is established to analyse the relation between RSS and the distance between two Bluetooth devices. Three distance-based algorithms are used for Bluetooth positioning: Least Square Estimation, Three-border and Centroid Method. Comparison results are analysed and the ways to improve the positioning accuracy are discussed.},

Unlike most of the previous works in gait recognition, using machine vision techniques, in our approach gait patterns are obtained from a physical sensor attached to the hip. Acceleration in 3 directions: up-down, forward-backward and sideways of the hip movement, which is obtained by the sensor, is used for authentication. Furthermore, we also present a study on the security strength of gait biometric against imitating or mimicking attacks, which has not been addressed in biometric gait recognition so far.},

We present uWave, an efficient recognition algorithm for such interaction using a single three-axis accelerometer. uWave requires a single training sample for each gesture pattern and allows users to employ personalized gestures. We evaluate uWave using a large gesture library with over 4000 samples for eight gesture patterns collected from eight users over one month. uWave achieves 98.6{\%} accuracy, competitive with statistical methods that require significantly more training samples. We also present applications of uWave in gesture-based user authentication and interaction with 3D mobile user interfaces. In particular, we report a series of user studies that evaluates the feasibility and usability of lightweight user authentication. Our evaluation shows both the strength and limitations of gesture-based user authentication. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The proposed method authenticates owner using acceleration signals obtained by an acceleration sensor embedded in the cellular phones during his arm sweep action. When the owner wants to unlock its security, he just needs to grasp and shake his cellular phone. The proposed method verifies owner's acceleration signals by using a DP-matching algorithm which can adapt fluctuations caused by different grip. Simulation results show that the proposed method can achieve the best equal error rate 5.0{\%} for 22 testers},

abstract = {With fast development in high performance computer area and modeling techniques, design of injury countermeasures based on numerical simulations could make the process more cost-efficient. To reduce the risks and uncertainties associated with the use of predictive models for design decision making, an increased attention should be paid to the validation process of human dummy models. The main goal of this study was to assess a numerical THOR dummy model in frontal crash environment using kinetic and kinematic test data and various validation metrics. A THOR-NT dummy positioned on a rigid planar seat and restrained by a standard 3-point shoulder and lap belt system was subjected to two frontal crash sled tests with “initial velocity 40 km/h”. In the numerical analysis, the dummy model was positioned in a test setup model using the same procedure employed in testing. The dynamic and kinematic data of dummy model were compared with corresponding test data using validation metrics implemented in two rating systems. The overall dummy kinematics, the 3D displacement time histories of certain dummy body regions, and the interaction forces of dummy with the sled and the belt obtained in simulation were in reasonable agreement with the corresponding test data. Generally, the rating scores showed to be sensitive to the validation metrics and to the weighting factors used in the assessment process. The current average score of THOR model positioned it in the “fair-to-acceptable” range, which would recommend it for use in impact simulations. The results of this study and the validation methodology may be used for further refinement of the current THOR model, in setting up future dummy tests, the assessment of other human dummy models, and the improvement of model rating methods.},

We present two implementations: one based on analyzing the frequency response of the speakerphone-microphone system, and another based on analyzing device-specific accelerometer calibration errors. Our accelerometer-based fingerprint is especially interesting because the accelerometer is accessible via JavaScript running in a mobile web browser without requesting any permissions or notifying the user. We present the results of the most extensive sensor fingerprinting experiment done to date, which measured sensor properties from over 10,000 mobile devices. We show that the entropy from sensor fingerprinting is sufficient to uniquely identify a device among thousands of devices, with low probability of collision.},

IT-related costs in car manufacturing are already high and they will increase dramatically in the future. Yet whereas safety and reliability have become a relatively well-established field, the protection of vehicular IT systems against systematic manipulation or intrusion has only recently started to emerge. Nevertheless, IT security is already the base of some vehicular applications such as immobilizers or digital tachographs. To securely enable future automotive applications and business models, IT security will be one of the central technologies for the next generation of vehicles. After a state-of-the-art overview of IT security in vehicles, we give a short intro- duction into cryptographic terminology and functionality. This contributionwill then identify the need for automotive IT security while presenting typical attacks, resulting security objectives, and characteristic constraints within the automotive area. We will introduce core security technologies and relevant securitymechanisms followed by a detailed description of critical vehicular ap- plications, business models, and components relying on IT security.We conclude our contributionwith a detailed statement about challenges and opportunities for the automotive IT community for embedding IT security in vehicles.},

Most automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) offer laser-based or radar-based adaptive cruise control (ACC) or precrash systems (PCSs). ACC employs forward-looking sensors for longitudinal control of the vehicle through brake and throttle actuation. PCSs additionally utilize rear-looking sensors and driver-recognition cameras to prepare the vehicle's cabin for an imminent collision by seat belt pretensioning and head-restraint repositioning. Similarly, OEMs are releasing lateral control systems such as lane-keeping assistants (LKAs) or lane-departure warnings (LDWs), which use computer vision to detect the vehicle's orientation relative to lane markings and provide feedback to the driver through audible, visual, or haptic signals.},

Networking and integrating active as well as passive vehicle safety systems constitutes an important approach to reduce the number of road deaths to zero (Vision Zero campaign [13]). Therefore special tools for developing and testing such integrated and networked automotive safety systems have to be devised. This paper points out one attempt at a solution: developing an integrated tool environment consisting of a Model-in-the-Loop, a Software-in-the-Loop and a real-time Hardware-in-the-Loop system containing a crash simulation based on real and simulated crash data as well as vehicle simulation. It also includes a fail-safe tester to be able to test the physical errors. With such a system, the development and test of new integrated safety systems will be facilitated and missed failures can be diminished. This paper describes the challenges in developing such a highly integrated and complex tool.},

The system is composed by a conditioning unit and a multichannel data acquisition board (NI 6251) connected to a computer through USB interface. The conditioning circuit of the system ensures the variable amplification, filtering and sample and hold function for the signals received from the sensors. The sampling frequency used in the system is 40 kHz, simultaneously for all three input channels. Also, for graphical displaying and further processing of measured data, a proprietary software application was developed in LabVIEW programming environment. By using a compact realization of the conditioning unit, a high speed data acquisition board and an attractive graphical interface is obtained a flexible system for accurate collision test in automotive industry. The system can be extended very easy by increasing the number of attached sensors and minor changes in the software application.},

abstract = {Mobile computing and sensing technologies present exciting opportunities for healthcare. Prescription wireless sensors worn by patients can automatically deliver medical data to care providers, dramatically improving their ability to diagnose, monitor, and manage a range of medical conditions. Using the mobile phones that patients already carry to provide connectivity between sensors and providers is essential to keeping costs low and deployments simple. Unfortunately, software-based attacks against phones are also on the rise, and successful attacks on privacy-sensitive and safety-critical applications can have significant consequences for patients. In this paper, we describe Plug-n-Trust (PnT), a novel ap- proach to protecting both the confidentiality and integrity of safety-critical medical sensing and data processing on vulnerable mobile phones. With PnT, a plug-in smart card provides a trusted computing environment, keeping data safe even on a compromised mobile phone. By design, PnT is simple to use and deploy, while providing a flexible programming interface amenable to a wide range of applications. We describe our implementation, designed for Java-based smart cards and Android phones, in which we use a split-computation model with a novel path hashing technique to verify proper behavior without exposing confidential data. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that PnT achieves its security goals while incurring acceptable overhead.},

abstract = {Security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) against cyber attacks is an important yet challenging problem. Since most cyber attacks happen in erratic ways, it is difficult to describe them systematically. In this paper, instead of identifying a specific cyber attack model, we are focused on analyzing the system's response during cyber attacks. Deception attacks (or false data injection attacks), which are performed by tampering with system components or data, are not of particular concern if they can be easily detected by the system's monitoring system. However, intelligent cyber attackers can avoid being detected by the monitoring system by carefully design cyber attacks. Our main objective is to investigate the performance of such stealthy deception attacks from the system's perspective. We investigate three kinds of stealthy deception attacks according to the attacker's ability to compromise the system. Based on the information about the dynamics of the system and existing hypothesis testing algorithms, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the attacker could perform each kind of attack without being detected. In the end, we illustrate the threat of these cyber attacks using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation example.},

This individual security design leads to several problems: combining several functions that are for its own secure may not result in a secure system. Furthermore, the combination of functions might also lead to situations, where mechanisms erroneously detect a security threat. This paper argues that new features, such as Car-2-Car communication or autonomous driving, will result in new information and communication technology (ICT) architectures of cars. The paper will outline basic properties of this architecture and summarize resulting security threads. We will argue that security needs to be treated in a holistic way and that the design must be suitable for adaptive, multiple independent levels of security (MILS) architecture.},

abstract = {In the last decade, the automotive industry, governments and researchers have invested a lot of effort setting up the basis for vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to infrastructure (V2X) communication with the aim of improving road safety and traffic efficiency. As for any communication involving the exchange of sensitive data, security was identified from the beginning as a key enabler for many use cases and has been already addressed in various projects. While the first focus was on security issues related to inter-vehicle communication, the Intelligent Transport System (ITS) community rapidly realized that in-vehicle security, which means secure communication endpoints, is also required to enable secure communication between cars and their environment. The recent successful hacking of automotive systems has strengthened this position. However, the holistic view required to set up a framework for mutual trust-establishment between the involving communication entities is missing. The reception of an authentic message does not provide sufficient proof of the trustworthiness of the message without additional trust assurance regarding the message's sender and the sender's platform integrity. Hence, the need to attest/certify the trustworthiness of a remote communication partner's platform is arising. In this paper, we analyze the platform security requirements of V2X systems, define different Trust Assurance Levels (TAL) and propose a certification framework to support trust establishment between involved V2X communication partners.},

abstract = {An upcoming trend for automotive manufacturers is to perform remote diagnostics and firmware updates over the air, which allows identifying hardware problems and correction of software flaws with minimal customer inconvenience. These procedures require that the previously isolated in-vehicle network permits external communication, which introduces a number of security risks, e.g., cyber attack threats. In this paper, we identify cyber attack threats and classify the electronic control units (ECUs) in the in-vehicle network to assist in determining which ones to protect and restrict access to. We divide the ECUs into five categories: powertrain, vehicle safety, comfort, infotainment, and telematics. We then use four safety integrity levels to classify the ECU categories. Moreover, we define safety effect levels of security threats which are used to classify identified attacks in the remote diagnostics and firmware updates over the air procedures. The safety and security levels are combined to classify the ECU categories. From the results we conclude that ECU categories such as powertrain and vehicle safety require further protection prior to introducing remote connectivity. As a conclusion, we suggest that automotive manufacturers should emphasize security or restrict the remote diagnostics and firmware updates over the air procedures to certain ECUs.},

abstract = {We consider a cyber-physical system consisting of two interacting networks, i.e., a cyber-network overlaying a physical-network. It is envisioned that these systems are more vulnerable to attacks since node failures in one network may result in (due to the interdependence) failures in the other network, causing a cascade of failures that would potentially lead to the collapse of the entire infrastructure. The robustness of interdependent systems against this sort of catastrophic failure hinges heavily on the allocation of the (interconnecting) links that connect nodes in one network to nodes in the other network. In this paper, we characterize the optimum inter-link allocation strategy against random attacks in the case where the topology of each individual network is unknown. In particular, we analyze the “regular” allocation strategy that allots exactly the same number of bi-directional inter-network links to all nodes in the system. We show, both analytically and experimentally, that this strategy yields better performance (from a network resilience perspective) compared to all possible strategies, including strategies using random allocation, unidirectional inter-links, etc. Keywords:},

abstract = {In Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), computer systems are invisible, but they are embedded in real-world entities, which are monitored and controlled. A key challenge of CPS is to assure high reliability in a scalable and dynamic computing environment in the presence of frequent data propagation among CPS nodes. To effectively manage such data delivery, CPS may need a data-centric middleware, such as the Data Distribution Service (DDS) specification, which makes it easy to deal with complicated data distribution. To support higher reliability, mission-critical CPS applications are often required to provide service even during code modification. Therefore, Dynamic Software Updates (DSU) can be effectively applied for the CPS applications. This paper presents a dynamically updating approach for DDS-centric CPS applications. The proposed approach consists of the following steps: (1) to publish update requests, (2) to subscribe to the interesting update requests, (3) to discover the CPS nodes with the new version of an updated file, and (4) to perform the updates. Our initial results indicate that DSU techniques can be applied to CPS applications, which are required to support high reliability and seamless service.},

abstract = {Most large scale traffic information systems rely on fixed sensors (e.g. loop detectors, cameras) and user generated data, this latter in the form of GPS traces sent by smartphones or GPS devices onboard vehicles. While this type of data is relatively inexpensive to gather, it can pose multiple security and privacy risks, even if the location tracks are anonymous. In particular, creating bogus location tracks and sending them to the system is relatively easy. This bogus data could perturb traffic flow estimates, and disrupt the transportation system whenever these estimates are used for actuation. In this article, we propose a new framework for solving a variety of privacy and cybersecurity problems arising in transportation systems. The state of traffic is modeled by the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards traffic flow model, which is a first order scalar conservation law with concave flux function. Given a set of traffic flow data, we show that the constraints resulting from this partial differential equation are mixed integer linear inequalities for some decision variable. The resulting framework is very flexible, and can in particular be used to detect spoofing attacks in real time, or carry out attacks on location tracks. Numerical implementations are performed on experimental data from the{\~{}}$\backslash$emph{\{}Mobile Century{\}} experiment to validate this framework.},

We propose an approach to address this challenge. We formulate a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem to generate a feasible trajectory for a vehicle. Constraints are particularly designed to ensure inter-vehicle safety. To further achieve system-wide safety and liveness, we additionally propose several simple yet effective rules for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) coordination. We establish system-wide safety and also liveness of the resulting autonomous traffic in various traffic situations such as single lane traffic, multi-lane traffic, and intersection crossing traffic.},

We proposes to seamlessly integrate networked and embedded sensing, computational intelligence, and real-time communication (cyber) into transportation infrastructure including vehicles and roadsides (physical) to facilitate self-organization and system coordination. Specifically, this research addresses two specific themes: Foundations by advancing basic theories in component fields and abstracting the particular knowledge into core principles that integrate cyber and physical processes; and Methods and Tools by designing alternative architectures, modeling a unified online system of cyber and physical elements. The integration of research and education will prepare the future workforce to operate and advance CPS.},

Specifically, the paper describes the principles of PTIDES, which leverages network time syn- chronization to provide a determinate distributed real-time semantics.We show how PTIDES can function as a coordination language, orchestrating components thatmay be designed and specified using different formalisms.

abstract = {Embedded systems, particularly real-time systems with temporal constraints, are increasingly deployed in every day life. Such systems that interact with the physical world are also referred to as cyber-physical systems (CPS). These systems commonly find use in critical infrastructure from transportation to health care. While security in CPS-based real-time embedded systems has been an afterthought, it is becoming a critical issue as these systems are increasingly networked and inter-dependent. The advancement in their functionality has resulted in more conspicuous interfaces that may be exploited to attack them. In this paper, we present three mechanisms for time-based intrusion detection. More specifically, we detect the execution of unauthorized instructions in real-time CPS environments. Such intrusion detection utilizes information obtained by static timing analysis. For real-time CPS systems, timing bounds on code sections are readily available as they are already determined prior to the schedulability analysis. We demonstrate how to provide micro-timings for multiple granularity levels of application code. Through bounds checking of these micro-timings, we develop techniques to detect intrusions (1) in a self-checking manner by the application and (2) through the operating system scheduler, which are novel contributions to the real-time/embedded systems domain to the best of our knowledge.},

Along this line, we propose an efficient mechanism to provide secrecy of the information. Traditional approaches based on encryption decrease the cooperation willingness of intermediate nodes, which have no expectation of recovering the file. Our scheme is based on obfuscation by processing and polluting the original file so that only the intended recipients, informed of corrupted blocks, can recover the information timely. We present several alternatives to efficiently provide weak secrecy and to foster cooperation. We simulate the file distribution in a vehicular network and show that the proposed scheme enhances content distribution in term of downloading speed and it is much more efficient than the ones that use encryption.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) integrate the virtual cyber world with the real physical world. Nowadays, the theories and applications of CPSs still face enormous challenges. In order to facilitate this emerging domain, a general test platform for CPSs, low-priced intelligent vehicle with Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) navigation, is designed to test and verify the proposed methods and theories. We in brief review the research progresses of CPSs, WSNs and unmanned vehicles. By means of deeply analyzing the test platform architecture and WSN navigation principle, the software and hardware of this platform are developed. The experiment results show that the resolution of wireless sensor navigation is less than 0.67m. On the basis of these, how to conduct studies from different perspectives is illustrated, and the implementation challenges are also outlined.},

abstract = {We present a generic yet practical framework for assessing security risks to cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Our framework can be used to benchmark security risks when information is less than perfect, and interdependencies of physical and computational components may result in correlated failures. Such environments are prone to externalities, and can cause huge societal losses. We focus on the risks that arise from interdependent reliability failures (faults) and security failures (attacks). We advocate that a sound assessment of these risks requires explicit modeling of the effects of both technology-based defenses and institutions necessary for supporting them. Thus, we consider technology-based security defenses grounded in information security tools and fault-tolerant control in conjunction with institutional structures. Our game-theoretic approach to estimating security risks facilitates more effective defenses, especially against correlated failures.},

abstract = {Modern society relies on a web of physical network infrastructures, such as power stations, telecommunication networks and transportation systems. Thanks to technological advances, these infrastructures have become increasingly dependent on one another and have emerged as interdependent networks. While interdependency enables to build systems that are larger, smarter and more complex, it is also observed that interdependent systems tend to be more fragile against failures, natural hazards and attacks. It is therefore of vital importance to develop the science for interdependent Networks, which serves as the foundation to better understand the interplays among individual networks and propel significant advances therein, such as the Internet, power grid, social networks, the financial system and the economy to name just a few. This paper aims at presenting our future research outlook oriented to the cloud, to mobile device security and to cyber physical systems and some challenges related to cyber physical systems.},

This paper will investigate QoS requirements for CPS and discuss the state of the art in CPS QoS techniques and models. Research challenges to providing QoS for CPS will be discussed and a new CPS framework that provides end-to-end QoS in a complex system-of-systems CPS will be presented.

This requires both new theories and engineering practices that model cyber and physical resources in a unified framework, a challenge that few current approaches are able to tackle. The solution must break the boundary between the cyber world and the physical world by providing a unified infrastructure that permits integrated models addressing issues from both worlds simultaneously.

abstract = {The concept of cooperative vehicle safety (CVS) is based on cooperation of vehicles in achieving real-time situation awareness for the purpose of safer (and possibly autonomous) driving. Since CVS is a safety system, situation awareness has to be real-time with high accuracy. Cooperation in the context of CVS is achieved through vehicular networks that are tuned to the purpose of vehicle state tracking in a neighborhood around each vehicle. In this paper, we describe different methodologies in approaching the design of CVS, and propose a systematic Cyber-Physical Systems approach to the design of CVS. Our proposed approach is to design the system in a top-down manner, by identifying system metrics such as approximate measures of awareness, and then characterizing component models and their interactions. For this purpose, processes that handle vehicle state estimation and dissemination of state information are studied and their interactions are modeled in order to derive an overall awareness quality metric. The result of analyzing and modeling such effects is then used in studying the design of adaptive control schemes for each component of CVS.},

abstract = {It is often appealing to assume that existing solutions can be directly applied to emerging engineering do- mains. Unfortunately, careful investigation of the unique chal- lenges presented by new domains exposes its idiosyncrasies, thus often requiring new approaches and solutions. In this paper, we argue that the Bsmart[ grid, replacing its incredibly successful and reliable predecessor, poses a series of new se- curity challenges, among others, that require novel approaches to the field of cyber security. We will call this new field cyber– physical security. The tight coupling between information and communication technologies and physical systems introduces new security concerns, requiring a rethinking of the commonly used objectives and methods. Existing security approaches are either inapplicable, not viable, insufficiently scalable, incom- patible, or simply inadequate to address the challenges posed by highly complex environments such as the smart grid. A con- certed effort by the entire industry, the research community, and the policy makers is required to achieve the vision of a secure smart grid infrastructure.},

It is critical that engineers and managers understand these issues and know how to locate the information they need. This paper provides a broad overview of cyber security and risk assessment for SCADA and DCS, introduces the main industry organizations and government groups working in this area, and gives a comprehensive review of the literature to date. Major concepts related to the risk assessment methods are introduced with references cited for more detail. Included are risk assessment methods such as HHM, IIM, and RFRM which have been applied successfully to SCADA systems with many interdependencies and have highlighted the need for quantifiable metrics. Presented in broad terms is probability risk analysis (PRA) which includes methods such as FTA, ETA, and FEMA. The paper concludes with a general discussion of two recent methods (one based on compromise graphs and one on augmented vulnerability trees) that quantitatively determine the probability of an attack, the impact of the attack, and the reduction in risk associated with a particular countermeasure.},

abstract = {Critical infrastructure sites and facilities are becoming increasingly dependent on interconnected physical and cyber-based real-time distributed control systems (RTDCSs). A mounting cybersecurity threat results from the nature of these ubiquitous and sometimes unrestrained communications interconnections. Much work is under way in numerous organizations to characterize the cyber threat, determine means to minimize risk, and develop mitigation strategies to address potential consequences. While it seems natural that a simple application of cyber-protection methods derived from corporate business information technology (IT) domain would lead to an acceptable solution, the reality is that the characteristics of RTDCSs make many of those methods inadequate and unsatisfactory or even harmful. A solution lies in developing a defense-in-depth approach that ranges from protection at communications interconnect levels ultimately to the control system's functional characteristics that are designed to maintain control in the face of malicious intrusion. This paper summarizes the nature of RTDCSs from a cybersecurity perspective and discusses issues, vulnerabilities, candidate mitigation approaches, and metrics.},

abstract = {In the last years there has been an increasing interest in the security of process control and SCADA systems. Furthermore, recent computer attacks such as the Stuxnet worm, have shown there are parties with the motivation and resources to effectively attack control systems. While previous work has proposed new security mechanisms for control systems, few of them have explored new and fundamentally different research problems for securing control systems when compared to securing traditional information technology (IT) systems. In particular, the sophistication of new malware attacking control systems--malware including zero-days attacks, rootkits created for control systems, and software signed by trusted certificate authorities--has shown that it is very difficult to prevent and detect these attacks based solely on IT system information. In this paper we show how, by incorporating knowledge of the physical system under control, we are able to detect computer attacks that change the behavior of the targeted control system. By using knowledge of the physical system we are able to focus on the final objective of the attack, and not on the particular mechanisms of how vulnerabilities are exploited, and how the attack is hidden. We analyze the security and safety of our mechanisms by exploring the effects of stealthy attacks, and by ensuring that automatic attack-response mechanisms will not drive the system to an unsafe state. A secondary goal of this paper is to initiate the discussion between control and security practitioners--two areas that have had little interaction in the past. We believe that control engineers can leverage security engineering to design--based on a combination of their best practices--control algorithms that go beyond safety and fault tolerance, and include considerations to survive targeted attacks.},

abstract = {In this article, we focus on a typical application of Cyber Physical System (CPS), i.e., vehicle route navigation. Two fundamental problems have been examined: 1) How different are various vehicle routing algorithms? 2) How valuable is real-time traffic information or historical traffic information in helping vehicle routing? Different from most previous works based on simulations, we presented performance comparisons of four routing algorithms using real GPS sensory data from 4000 taxis. It has been shown that using real-time traffic information could substantially improve the quality of vehicle path routing. This can bene- fit an individual driver, because through our evaluation results on realistic vehicle traces we found that the paths selected by taxi drivers are not as good as expected. More importantly, utilizing real-time information could improve global transportation efficiency in terms of dispers- ing/managing traffic, which plays a key role in construct- ing an effective vehicular CPS.},

abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are sensing, communication and processing platforms, deeply embedded in physical processes and provide real-time monitoring and actuation services. Such systems are becoming increasing common in enabling many of the pervasive computing technologies that are becoming available today such as, smart-homes, smart-vehicles, pervasive health monitoring systems. Given the automation that CPSs introduce in managing physical processes, and the detail of information available to them for carrying out their tasks, securing them is of prime importance. In this dissertation, a novel security paradigm for CPSs is proposed, called Cyber-Physical Security (CYPSec). CYPSec solutions are unique in that they take they take into account the environmentally-coupled nature of CPSs in enabling security solutions. This dissertation explores CYPSec solutions for two diverse but related problems. The first is a usable and secure key agreement protocol called Physiological Signal based Key Agreement (PSKA), which combines signal processing and cryptographic primitives to enable automated key agreement between sensors in a Body Area Network (BAN) without any form of external user involvement. It uses specific physiological stimuli-based features (Photoplethsymogram and Electrocardio- gram) from the human body for its task. The second is an access control model called Criticality Aware Access Control (CAAC), which facilitates a more adaptive and proactive provisioning of authorizations - provide the right set of privileges for the right set of subjects, at the right time for the right duration - for managing emergencies within smart-infrastructures.},

abstract = {A probe data service has been defined as a means for vehicular on-board units (OBUs) to transmit the data collected by their in-vehicle sensors in real time via wireless communication links to road-site units (RSUs). Sensor data fusion algorithms are developed in this work to aggregate data collected through this probe data service for computing single-RSU and multi-RSU average per-division speeds and average route travel times, where a division is defined to be a small segment of a road. These algorithms are evaluated using an integrated simulation testbed that consists of a vehicular simulator and a wireless communication link simulator, which are interconnected via a TCP/IP connection. Our key findings are that the probe data service offers an excellent means for computing average per-division speeds and average route travel times when the market penetration level of OBUs is relatively high. Privacy constraints negatively impact the accuracy of route travel time estimates as routes often span roads under the wireless coverage area of many road-side units requiring frequent vehicle identity changes. The impact of wireless communication losses is quite significant, requiring the use of accurate models in any simulation-based studies.},

Also, the automation CPSs bring in managing physical processes, and the detail of information available to them for carrying out their tasks, make securing them a prime importance. Securing CPSs is a difficult task as systems are interconnected. In order to achieve a continuous secured CPS environment, there is the need for an integrated methodology to analyze, specify and prioritize security requirements and also to develop policies to meet them. First, CPS assets are represented using high-order object models. Second, swimlane diagrams are extended to include malactivities and prevention or mitigation options to decompose use cases. We analyze security threats pertaining to the hardware components, software components and the hardware-software interaction. Security requirements are then specified, and an analytical prioritization approach, based on relative priority analysis is employed to prioritize them. Finally, security policies are then developed to meet the requirements. To demonstrate its effectiveness and evaluate its application, the proposed methodology is applied in a structured approach to a testbed – Ayushman, a Pervasive Health Monitoring System (PHMS).},

Many forms of attacks against VANETs have emerged recently that attempt to compromise the security of such networks. Such security attacks on VANETs may lead to catastrophic results such as the loss of lives or loss of revenue for those value-added services. Therefore making VANETs secure has become a key objective for VANET designers. To develop and deploy secure VANET infrastructures remains a significant challenge.

abstract = {It is essential to consider drivers' perceptions and reactions when building Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems (VCPS) since the effectiveness and efficiency of VCPS will largely depend on how drivers could benefit from such a system. This paper considers, for the first time, novel service scheduling problems from a Human Factors (HF) standpoint by taking into consideration the following fact: a driver may not be able to receive more than one service in a short period of time, even if multiple services can be transmitted to the driver from the conventional communications and networking standpoint. We study a family of the HF-aware Service Scheduling (HFSS) Problems, where the goal is to deliver up to n services, each having a time-dependent (and possibly decreasing) utility to a subset of intended drivers so as to minimize the system-wide total utility loss due to unsuccessful delivery of some services. We show that such problems are different from all existing problems. We formulate the basic HFSS problem (BHFSSP) using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and prove its NP-Completeness. We then propose efficient heuristics for BHFSSP and its more general versions, and present numerical results from large-scale test cases. We also address several practical issues related to wireless transmission failures, distributed implementation in the multisender scenario, and other HF related considerations.},

abstract = {One of the main characteristics of a Cyber Physical System (CPS) is the tight coupling of the computing and communications aspects of the system with its physical dynamics. In this paper, we examine this characteristic for a cooperative vehicle safety (CVS) system, and identify how the design and operation of such CPSs should consider this tight coupling. In CVS systems, vehicles broadcast their physical state information over a shared wireless network to allow their neighbors to track them and predict possible collisions. The physical dynamics of vehicle movement and the required accuracy from tracking process dictate certain load on the network. The network performance is directly affected by the amount of offered load, and in turn directly affects the tracking process and its required load. The tight mutual dependence of physical dynamics of vehicle (physical component), estimation/tracking process and communication process (cyber components) require a new look at how such systems are designed and operated. We consider these factors and propose methods to simplify the design procedure for such tightly coupled systems. The method includes modeling the subcomponent of the CPS and devising interaction and control algorithms to operate them. The proposed methods are compared with methods based on separate design of components that deal with physical and cyber aspects. Through simulation experiments we show significant gains in performance when CPS design considerations are respected.},

abstract = {Vehicular networks are a classic example of mobile, peer-to-peer networks. The domain of intelligent transportation engineering (ITS) envisions a wide range of services over these vehicular networks. Supporting the different quality of service properties of these services requires effective dynamic resource management solutions in vehicular networks, which cannot be realized using vehicles alone due to factors such as varying vehicular mobility patterns, varying vehicular traffic density, and obstacles. Road side units (RSUs), which serve as event and data brokers among the moving vehicles, can alleviate this problem. To maximize the value proposition offered by RSUs requires their effective placement that holistically accounts for physical factors, such as traffic patterns and mobility, with cyber factors, such as communication protocols and messaging. To address these requirements, this paper presents a design methodology based on the principles of surrogate modeling wherein small- scale, micro-simulations of the ITS cyber-physical system are used to develop training points, which in turn are used to train a surrogate model. The surrogate model is subsequently used to make planning decisions for ITS.},

We develop two intrusion detection techniques, namely, positional discontinuity and enviroconsistency, for intrusion detection of malicious attackers in a CPS. We utilize the hierarchical model developed to analyze the performance characteristics of these two techniques and identify optimal design settings under which the reliability of the CPS may be maximized. The analysis reveals design tradeoffs in security assurance and energy consumption, and suggests that enviroconsistency be used over positional discontinuity for reliability maximization. Numerical results with physical interpretations are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {In this paper, an efficient identity-based batch signature verification scheme is proposed for vehicular communications. With the proposed scheme, vehicles can verify a batch of signatures once instead of in a one-by-one manner. Hence the message verification speed can be tremendously increased. To identify invalid signatures in a batch of signatures, this paper adopts group testing technique, which can find the invalid signatures with few number of batch verifications. In addition, a trust authority in our scheme is capable of tracing a vehicle's real identity from its pseudo identity, and therefore conditional privacy preserving can also be achieved. Moreover, since identity-based cryptography is employed in the scheme to generate private keys for pseudo identities, certificates are not required and thus transmission overhead can be significantly reduced.},

abstract = {Wireless Communication is vital during natural calamities, disasters and military operation. In the past few decades, security in the military operations is exposed to vulnerabilities like sniffing the information and modifying the data causing havoc in military camps. Consequently military applications required a secure way to exchange the data and stay away from enemy intrusion. Recent trends in military operations need a portable way of communicating between the units, quality of service and security to be full-fledged. However, in MANET mobile entities are prone to various security attacks due to dynamic changing topology, open medium and inhibited by limited energy, bandwidth and computational power. The paper addresses the security issues by incorporating the concept of Trust and Certification Authority to combat the misbehaving entities. Certificate Authority employs Fuzzy based analyzer to distinguish between trusted and malicious behavior of nodes by distributing the certificates only to the trusted nodes and detecting the misbehaving node. The proposed scheme is more secure, reliable and aids to improve the security in military operations.},

In VANET, messages exchanged among vehicles may be damaged by attacker nodes. Therefore, security in message forwarding is an important factor. We propose the Detection of Malicious Vehicles (DMV) algorithm through monitoring to detect malicious nodes that drop or duplicate received packets and to isolate them from honest vehicles, where each vehicle is monitored by some of it trustier neighbors called verifier nodes. If a verifier vehicle observes an abnormal behavior from vehicle V, it increases distrust value of vehicle V. The ID of vehicle V is then reported to its relevant Certificate Authority (CA) as a malicious node when its distrust value is higher than a threshold value. Performance evaluation shows that DMV can detect most existence abnormal and malicious vehicles even at high speeds.},

With vehicle positions being the most frequently exchanged information in vehicular networks, it becomes imperative to establish a strong level of trust in the announced positions before a vehicle initiates a response. This paper proposes a position verification scheme as part of a misbehavior detection framework that encompasses analysis techniques needed for the verification of exchanged vehicular messages. The scheme involves the estimation of a vehicle's trajectory via the integration of road and map information, as opposed to only depending on the vehicle's kinematics for future trajectory prediction. The trajectory estimation procedure uses the vehicle's previously received position updates to find a bestfit area within the road topology in which the vehicle is expected to be. The vehicle's current position announcement is compared against this plausible area to decide whether the position is consistent with the expected location. Our proposed scheme is verified via extensive simulations, developed on ns2, demonstrating the importance of integrating road and map information into position verification.},

abstract = {In any vehicular adhoc network, there is always a possibility of incorrect messages being transmitted either due to faulty sensors and/or intentional malicious activities. Detecting and evicting sources of such misbehavior is an important problem. We observe that the performance of misbehavior detection schemes will depend on the application under consideration and the mobility dynamics of the detecting vehicle. Further, the underlying tradeoff in any such detection algorithm is the balance between False Positives and False Negatives; one would like to detect as many misbehaviors as possible, while at the same time ensuring that the genuine vehicles are not wrongly accused. In this work we propose and analyze (via simulations) the performance of a Misbehavior Detection Scheme (MDS) for Post Crash Notification (PCN) application. We observe that the performance of this proposed scheme is not very sensitive to the exact dynamics of the vehicle on small scales, so that slight error in estimating the dynamics of the detecting vehicle does not degrade the performance of the MDS.},

As each vehicle cannot be a source of all messages in VANET, most communications depend on the information received from other vehicles. To protect VANET from malicious action, each vehicle must be able to evaluate, decide and react locally on information received from other vehicles. Message verification is more challenging in VANETs since the security and privacy of the participating vehicles, in general, and of the drivers and passengers specifically is of major concern. Each vehicle needs to verify the accuracy of the message and needs to verify that the received message is from a legitimate vehicle. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to secure vehicular communication with the help of trust measured for the given period using a probabilistic approach. The proposed algorithm secures VANETs against the untrustworthy drivers. The proposed algorithm is illustrated through numerical results obtained from simulations.},

abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET) is a class of ad hoc networks build to ensure the safety of traffic. This is important because accidents claim many lives. Trust and security remain a major concern in VANET since a simple mistake can have catastrophic consequence. A crucial point in VANET is how to trust the information transmitted when the neighboring vehicles are rapidly changing and moving in and out of range. Current reputation systems for VANET try to establish trust between entities, which might not be required for practical scenarios. Due to the ephemeral nature of VANET, reputation schemes for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) cannot be applied to VANET. In this thesis, we point out several limitations of reputation trust management schemes for VANET. In particular, we identify the problem of information cascading and oversampling, which commonly arise in social networks. Oversampling is a situation in which a node observing two or more nodes, takes into consideration both their opinions equally without knowing that they might have influenced each other in decision making. We show that simple voting for decision making, leads to oversampling. We propose a solution to overcome this problem in VANET. We also suggest new ways to merge reputation schemes with misbehavior detection schemes to establish a trustworthy VANET.},

abstract = {A transition from free flow to congested traffic on highways often originates spontaneously and despite the fact that the road could satisfy a higher traffic demand. The reasons for such a traffic breakdown are perturbations caused by human drivers in dense traffic. We present a strategy to reduce traffic congestion with the help of vehicle-to-vehicle communication. Periodically emitted beacons are used to analyze traffic flow and to warn other drivers of a possible traffic breakdown. Drivers who receive such a warning are told to keep a larger gap to their predecessor. By doing so, they are less likely the source of perturbations which can cause a traffic breakdown. We analyze the proposed strategy via computer simulations and investigate which fraction of communicating vehicles is necessary until a beneficial influence on traffic flow is observable. We show that penetration rates of ten percent and less can have significant influence on traffic flow and travel times. Besides applying a realistic mobility model we further increase the degree of realism by the use of empirical traffic data from loop detectors on a German Autobahn.},

We also introduce a new attack termed wormhole-aided sybil attack on PBR. Our study indicates that the wormhole-aided sybil attack has the worst impact on the packet delivery in PBR. To ensure the reliability of PBR in VANETs, we propose a set of plausibility checks that can mitigate the impact of these PBR attacks. The proposed plausibility checks do not require adding extra hardware to the vehicles. In addition, they can adapt to different road characteristics and traffic conditions. Simulation results are given to demonstrate that the proposed plausibility checks are able to efficiently mitigate the impact of the previously mentioned PBR attacks.},

abstract = {This article describes a scheme which to the best of our knowledge is the first one to use user signatures to share information about Points of Interest in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks. In this scheme, users rate restaurants, hotels, etc. and sign those rates with their private key. Then, they broadcast that information and other vehicles store it for future use. When another user needs a Point of Interest recommendation he queries the system for the other users stored reviews and after he visits that Points of Interest for himself, he evaluates it and his level of trust in the reviewers with rates similar to his own increases. In the end, a user will be able to request to his vehicle information on a certain Point of Interest category and it will respond with the recommendations made by other users, prioritizing the ones in the user's Web of Trust. poiSim is the tool designed to simulate this scheme. It processes a 24 h mobility trace produced by a Multi-Agent Traffic Simulator, which realistically simulates public and private traffic over regional maps of Switzerland. The result is a Chains of Trust simulation with over 260,000 nodes, which shows that the proposed scheme performs satisfactorily in a realistic scenario.},

abstract = {Vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) can offer various services and benefits to VANET users and thus deserves deployment effort. Misusing such network could cause destructive consequences. It is therefore necessary to discourage misbehavior and defend VANET systems against it, in order to ensure correct and smooth operations of the network. In this paper, we review the techniques for handling misbehavior in VANETs, particularly where anony- mous communications are desired to conserve user privacy since it adds more complexity to the defense against misbehavior. A new scheme is proposed to punish misbehaving users and can be employed in both inter-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure anonymous communications. Our scheme leverages some threshold authentication technique that dynamically revokes a user's credential, while providing the flexibility of whether to reveal the user's identity and tolerating unintentional misbehavior such as hardware malfunctioning.},

abstract = {Vehicular communication (VC) systems are being developed primarily to enhance transportation safety and efficiency. Vehicle-to-vehicle communication, in particular, frequent cooperative awareness messages or safety beacons, has been considered over the past years as a main approach. Meanwhile, the need to provide security and to safeguard users' privacy is well understood, and security architectures for VC systems have been proposed. Although technical approaches to secure VC have several commonalities and a consensus has formed, there are critical questions that have remained largely unanswered: Are the proposed security and privacy schemes practical? Can the secured VC systems support the VC-enabled applications as effectively as unsecured VC would? How should security be designed so that its integration into a VC system has a limited effect on the system's performance? In this paper, we provide answers to these questions, investigating the joint effect of a set of system parameters and components. We consider the state-of-the-art approach in secure VC, and we evaluate analytically and through simulations the interdependencies among components and system characteristics. Overall, we identify key design choices for the deployment of efficient, effective, and secure VC systems.},

Also, we have witnessed the merging of computing and telecommunications. This excellent combination of two important fields has propelled our capability even further, allowing us to communicate anytime and anywhere, improving our work flow and increasing our quality of life tremendously. The next wave of evolution we foresee is the convergence of telecommunication, computing, wireless, and transportation technologies. Once this happens, our roads and highways will be both our communications and transportation platforms, which will completely revolutionize when and how we access services and entertainment, how we communicate, commute, navigate, etc., in the coming future. This paper presents an overview of the current state-of-the-art, discusses current projects, their goals, and finally highlights how emergency services and road safety will evolve with the blending of vehicular communication networks with road transportation.},

abstract = {Detecting misbehavior (such as transmissions of false information) in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is a very important problem with wide range of implications, including safety related and congestion avoidance applications. We discuss several limitations of existing misbehavior detection schemes (MDS) designed for VANETs. Most MDS are concerned with detection of malicious nodes. In most situations, vehicles would send wrong information because of selfish reasons of their owners, e.g. for gaining access to a particular lane. It is therefore more important to detect false information than to identify misbehaving nodes. We introduce the concept of data-centric misbehavior detection and propose algorithms which detect false alert messages and misbehaving nodes by observing their actions after sending out the alert messages. With the data-centric MDS, each node can decide whether an information received is correct or false. The decision is based on the consistency of recent messages and new alerts with reported and estimated vehicle positions. No voting or majority decisions is needed, making our MDS resilient to Sybil attacks. After misbehavior is detected, we do not revoke all the secret credentials of misbehaving nodes, as done in most schemes. Instead, we impose fines on misbehaving nodes (administered by the certification authority), discouraging them to act selfishly. This reduces the computation and communication costs involved in revoking all the secret credentials of misbehaving nodes.},

@article{Dressler2011,
abstract = {Intervehicle communication has become an extremely hot topic in networking research, opening up new research challenges well beyond those of classical mobile ad hoc network research. In October 2010, a Dagstuhl seminar has been organized bringing together many of the internationally leading experts in this field to discuss open issues and challenges related to IVC. This article reports the main findings of this meeting, that was set up to cover a wide range of topics. In particular, the following four areas were studied in working groups: Fundamental Limits and Opportunities of IVC, IVC Communication Principles and Patterns, Security and Privacy in IVC, and IVC Simulation and Modeling. A general conclusion drawn is that IVC is now at a turning point where the firstgeneration systems are engineered and will soon be brought to the market, while at the same time, IVC is experiencing the beginning of a new era characterized by a more fundamental research approach.},

@article{Markvollrath2011,
abstract = {Although Cruise Control (CC) is available for most cars, no studies have been found which examine how this automation system influences driving behaviour. However, a relatively large number of studies have examined Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) which compared to CC includes also a distance control. Besides positive effects with regard to a better compliance to speed limits, there are also indications of smaller distances to lead vehicles and slower responses in situations that require immediate braking. Similar effects can be expected for CC as this system takes over longitudinal control as well. To test this hypothesis, a simulator study was conducted at the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Twenty-two participants drove different routes (highway and motorway) under three different conditions (assisted by ACC, CC and manual driving without any system). Different driving scenarios were examined including a secondary task condition. On the one hand, both systems lead to lower maximum velocities and less speed limit violations. There was no indication that drivers shift more of their attention towards secondary tasks when driving with CC or ACC. However, there were delayed driver reactions in critical situations, e.g., in a narrow curve or a fog bank. These results give rise to some caution regarding the safety effects of these systems, especially if in the future their range of functionality (e.g., ACC Stop-and-Go) is further increased.},

abstract = {The complexity and connectivity of modern ve- hicles has constantly increased over the past years. Within the scope of this development the security risk for the in- vehicle network and its components has risen massively. Apart from threats for comfort and confidentiality, these attacks can also affect safety critical systems of the vehicle and therefore endanger the driver and other road users. In this paper the introduction of anomaly detection systems to the automotive in-vehicle network is discussed. Based on properties of typical vehicular networks, like the Controller Area Network (CAN), a set of anomaly detection sensors is introduced which allow the recognition of attacks during the operation of the vehicle without causing false positives. Moreover, important design and application criteria for a vehicular attack detection system are explained and discussed.},

abstract = {The development of automotive cyber-physical systems (CPS) software needs to consider not only functional requirements, but also non-functional requirements and the interaction with physical environment. In this paper, a model-based software development method for automotive CPS (MoBDAC) is presented. The main contributions of this paper are threefold. First, MoBDAC covers the whole development workflow of automotive CPS software from modeling and simulation to code generation. Automatic tools are used to improve the development efficiency. Second, MoBDAC extracts non- functional requirements and deals with them in the implementation model level and source code level, which helps to correctly manage and meet non-functional requirements. Third, MoBDAC defines three kinds of relations between uncertain physical environment events and software internal actions in automotive CPS, and uses Model Modifier to integrate the interaction with physical environment. Moreover, we illustrate the development workflow of MoBDAC by an example of a power window development.},

abstract = {This paper presents an application of an Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) for pre-diagnosing incipient underlying in-vehicle network problems which possibly could cause further failures.Anexperiment on ANFIS-based pre-diagnosis of network level faults on Controller Area Network (CAN) by utilising available network protocol signals, such as error frames, is reported. The experimental results show that the pre-diagnostic system can efficiently classify causes of error frames transmitted on aCANbus, and identify “network health” which indicates healthiness of the networkwhenbeing used for message communication. The potential causes of the faults can be narrowed down, and further network diagnostics and prognostics can be performed.},

@article{Sathiyan2011,
abstract = {The important feature of the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system is the ability to maintain a proper inter-vehicle gap based on the speed of leading vehicle and the desired distance. Adaptive Cruise Control operates in two modes (i) Velocity Control mode, (ii) Distance Control mode. ACC acts like a conventional Cruise Controller (CC) under velocity control mode. In the case of the distance control mode, the speed of the host vehicle is reduced according to the surrounding environment to maintain the safe distance between the leading vehicle and the host vehicle. 25 rules have been used in Fuzzy logic Controller (FLC) with the knowledge base of the system. The inputs of the FLC are distance error and the speed error. The host vehicle adapts to the lead vehicle speed changes and tries to maintain a proper distance between them. The performance of the FLC based ACC is improved by Genetic Algorithm to tune the fuzzy rule base. Genetic Programming is used to select the best rule out of the 25 for a corresponding input. The result showed a better improvement over the Fuzzy Controlled System.},

@article{Gunstone2009,
abstract = {The potential for vehicular applications is rapidly increasing. However this variety also demands a flexible multihop communication protocol supporting different communications needs and adapting to the network environment and to context elements specified by the application itself. We think that adaptive solutions, recently starting to be applied to VANET routing and dissemination protocols, have a great potential for solving the problems stated above. The objective of this chapter is to introduce the reader to these kinds of solutions, show their benefits and also mention the challenges involved. Because one important aspect of adaptive solutions (in this case a common communication protocol for all applications), is having in-depth knowledge of the problem to solve, we first review these different vehicular applications and their classification, followed by their communication needs.},

@inproceedings{Arafin2017,
abstract = {Incorporating security protocols in IoT components is challenging due to their extremely constrained resources. We address this challenge by proposing a hardware-oriented lightweight authentication protocol based on device signature generated during voltage over-scaling (VOS). First, we demonstrate that VOS-based computing leaves a process variation dependent error signature in its approximate results. This error can be methodically profiled to extract information about the underlying process variation in the computation unit. We then combine this error profile with security key based authentication schemes to create a two-factor authentication mechanism. To understand the effectiveness of this protocol, we perform detailed security analysis under various attack scenarios. Finally, we simulate the authentication hardware using a process variation aware 45nm design library in HSpice. Simulation results show that our VOS-based assumptions are valid, and this authentication mechanism can withstand basic environmental variations. Overall, our approach provides a unique approach for using hardware process variations as a key for authentication.},

@article{Christidis2016,
abstract = {Motivated by the recent explosion of interest around blockchains, we examine whether they make a good fit for the Internet of Things (IoT) sector. Blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-trusting members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary, in a verifiable manner. We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts—scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.},
